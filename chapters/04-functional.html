Developer: (Builds a plane...)
Product Owner: &quot;Uh... I actually just needed a ship.&quot;
Developer: Uh... ok...</code></pre>
<p>Although the above scenario sounds contrived, this happens a lot on a smaller
scale in software teams. Requirements from product management are
sometimes poorly specified, causing developers to have to guess what&apos;s on
the product owner&apos;s mind. This leads to developers coming up with
products that are over-engineered or worse; the implementation sometimes misses
the mark and fails to build the intended product.</p><h2 id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What can we do about it?</h2><p>We need something to bridge the gap between the product owner and the
developer. Something that can describe exactly what is being built so everyone is on the same page and no effort is wasted. A tool that tries to solve this is
<a href="https://cucumber.io/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>. Cucumber is a testing tool that supports
<a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/" target="_blank">behavior driven development (BDD)</a>, an extension of test driven development (TDD). In TDD,
developers write tests before writing code, whereas in BDD, the specifications
(or behaviors, hence BDD) are written before code is written. These
specifications are what the user actually wants in the product. In Cucumber,
these feature specifications are usually written by the product owner in
collaboration with the development team. The developers would then implement
them. The specifications can then be executed with Cucumber to ensure
that they are working as intended. In some sense, the
specifications are now the tests and they can be run as part of the CI
pipeline.</p><p>In summary a BDD cycle would look like this:</p><ul><li>Product owner writes feature specifications in collaboration with the development team.
</li>
<li>Developers implement the feature.
</li>
<li>Cucumber tests are executed in CI to ensure specifications were met.
</li></ul>
<h2 id="example-of-a-feature-specificaton">Example of a feature specificaton</h2><p>In Cucumber, product specifications are written in features files using a Domain-specific Language (DSL) known as Gherkin. In its simplest form, Gherkin programs consist of a series of Given-When-Then clauses that are close to natural language. Here&apos;s an example
of a feature file in Cucumber that specifies a feature for a calculator
program:</p><pre><code class="lang-cucumber">Feature: Addition
  Scenario: Calculate the sum of two integers
    Given two integers
    When the add button is pressed
    Then the sum of the two integers should be displayed</code></pre>
<p>Being very close to natural language, it is readable by stakeholders in the
organization and non-technical product owners. In the above example it is clear
how the user is interacting with the program, what the inputs and preconditions
are, and what should be expected. These properties are described using the
Given-When-Then language:</p><ul><li><code>Given</code>: describes the preconditions of the feature
</li>
<li><code>When</code>: describes the action that the user carries out in the feature
</li>
<li><code>Then</code>: desribes what&apos;s expected after the action is performed
</li></ul>
<p>In Cucumber, these are known as steps. Each step when evaluated has a
predefined behavior. Although Cucumber comes with some predefined steps,
developers can extend the language to suit their applications. For
example, the following step uses the <code>click_on</code> method defined in the
<code>capybara</code> ruby gem. It navigates to the home page when Cucumber sees a step
that says <code>When the home button is clicked</code>:</p><pre><code class="lang-ruby">When(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^the home button is clicked$/</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  click_on <span class="hljs-string">&apos;Home&apos;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="executable-user-stories">Executable user stories</h2><p>In an agile team, this feature file is also known as a user story. It defines a
user&apos;s requirements in the way the user would interact with the software. Apart
from being a document to communicate the requirements of a user, this
feature file can be executed and run against the product to ensure that the
product meets the user&apos;s requirements and use cases as described in the story. To
do so, Cucumber evaluates the Gherkin language, populates the test environment
with the preconditions and input, simulates the interaction with the
program, and lastly checks the actual behavior of the program against the
desired behavior as specified in the feature file.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><p>Cucumber and BDD close the gap between the non-technical requirements and
technical implementation. They also close the gap between the product owners and
the developers. When writing in Gherkin, software teams have to think about
the requirements in a user-centric way. Requirements are no longer just &quot;Build
a calculator that adds&quot;; with Given-When-Then clauses, developers have to
think harder about preconditions, inputs, and expectations of each feature.
What&apos;s more, with Cucumber, these files are executable, thus ensuring that the
working implementation of the program runs exactly in the way that is described
in the feature file.</p>
