Mocking System Testing using Capture and Replay</h1><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><em>Software Composition Analysis</em> (<em>SCA</em>) has gained traction in industry with
offerings from various companies. It helps developers identify vulnerable
open-source libraries used in the software they develop. The following picture
shows the architecture of an SCA system:</p><p><img alt="Software Composition Analysis System" src="../images/sca-overview.png"></p><p>In an SCA system, a customer scans their applications using a scanner software,
which will then send the evidence of third-party dependencies to a server for
matching with known vulnerabilities, whose data stored in a vulnerability
database. The vulnerability database itself is curated by a team security
researchers in years.</p><p>Veracode provides an <em>Agent-Based Scan</em> service using a <em>Command-Line Interface</em>
(<em>CLI</em>) agent that the customers run on their own machines to scan for
vulnerable libraries used by their applications. The SCA CLI agent sends the
evidence of third-party libraries to a data server, which matches them with
known vulnerable libraries in the database.</p><p>Veracode&apos;s CLI agent runs on the customer&apos;s side, and it is important to ensure
that it works correctly, given the environment the customer runs the agent in.
There are three kinds of automated testing that we perform for the CLI agent:</p><ol><li><p><em>Unit testing</em>, which is the test that the output or behavior of methods are
correct, given some input.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Integration testing</em>, which is to actually execute the agent in various
configurations, but scanning mocks instead of actual projects. Here we
observe the actual output of the agent, such as its return value. There is no
actual communication with the SCA vulnerability database server.</p></li>
<li><p><em>System testing</em>, which is to actually execute the agent for scanning
real projects and observe its behavior. Here the test checks the correctness
of the actual messages sent by the agent to the server, which constitute the
output of the agent.</p></li></ol>
<p>In this article we discuss our approach to system testing, which, in order to
test for the output correctness, generates checks using a <em>capture</em> mechanism
and perform the actual test using a <em>replay</em> mechanism. The advantage of using
such mechanisms is that it allows us to <em>mock</em> the SCA server and the library
repositories during agent run, such as when issues are detected by the tests, we
will be able to immediately localize as an issue belonging to the agent itself.
As at the time of writing, for Veracode agent-based scan, the system testing has
been implemented for real project scans on the Linux platform, and the same for
Windows platform is planned.</p><h2 id="testing-objectives">Testing Objectives</h2><p>Testing can be done for various purposes, such as for testing the usability and
performance of the software being developed. Here our strategic purpose of
performing system testing is to detect <em>regression</em>, that is, the reduction in
the quality of the CLI agent, which potentially happens as the agent is being
updated. Particularly, with our system testing we want to ensure that the CLI
agent and the SCA server, as well as the library repositories work well
together, particularly after making updates to the source code of the CLI agent.</p><p>The technical objectives include two:</p><ul><li><p>To ensure that the agent actually performs the computation that we expect of
it. That is, for <em>validation</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure that the result of the computation is what we expect. That is, for
<em>ensuring correctness</em>.</p></li></ul>
<p>It should be obvious that the major limitation of testing is in the limited
number of ways we can validate or ensure correct the software under test. We
cannot ensure that the software will be have correctly if the particular
behavior is untested. In other words, it is unable to ensure that something
unexpected will never happen.</p><p>Testing is typically done by executing the software or part of it, and observe
the outcome. Validation can be performed by observing that the execution does
reach some favorable end points (no exceptions, hangs, etc., unless these are
what we test the software for), whereas correctness can be determined by
observing that whenever a favorable end state is reached, the computation result
matches expectation.</p><h2 id="capture-and-replay">Capture and Replay</h2><p>The following message sequence chart shows a simplification of the interactions
among the CLI agent, the SCA server, and the library repository (e.g., Maven
central, PyPi, etc.) when the CLI agent scans a repository:</p><p><img alt="CLI Agent Interaction with the SCA Server" src="../images/agent-server-interaction.png"></p><p>The purpose of our system testing is to test the interactions between the SCA
system&apos;s components, where it needs to check that the proper interaction is
actually performed (validation), and that the content of the interaction is as
expected (correctness). The CLI agent is a highly complex software, which limits
us into performing black-box testing only. In black-box testing, we check for
the outputs of the system under test without considering the implementation
details of the system itself. Therefore, when scanning a project implemented in
a particular language or build system, we test that <em>the CLI agent sends the
correct requests</em> to the SCA server. This is because we consider the requests to
be the outputs of the CLI agent. As we can see here, we perform validation by
observing that the CLI agent actually sends the requests during its execution,
and we ensure correctness by observing that each time the CLI agent sends a
request, it sends the <em>correct</em> one.</p><p>Here we need to define what is a correct request. We define a <em>correct</em> request
to be a request that matches our record, when the same project was scanned last.
Therefore, there is a need to store the requests for a successful run once, for
comparison with subsequent runs.</p><p>Not only the requests, we also need to record the responses sent back by the SCA
server and the library repository to the CLI agent. These responses are from the
previous successful run, so that when the failure occurs in repeat runs, we can
isolate the cause to be that of the CLI agent and not due to changes and
failures in the remote systems (the SCA server or the library repository).</p><p>The system testing framework thus supports two separate activities:</p><ol><li><p>The <em>capture</em> of the interactions (requests and responses). Here, <code>mitmdump</code>
from the <a href="https://mitmproxy.org" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a> suite is used. <code>mitmdump</code> is
started with a custom script that logs all requests and responses to JSON
files. In this activity, the framework executes the agent and records the
agent&apos;s HTTP requests, together with the QA SCA server&apos;s and library
repository&apos;s responses. The raw requests and responses are collated into a
<em>cassette</em> (so they can later be replayed without actually contacting the
servers) and a JSON file containing all requests made.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>replay</em> of the interactions (requests and responses) for testing. This
is the actual test execution. Here, when the agent sends a request, the
request reaches a local proxy (<code>mitmdump</code>), which then forwards it to a local
mock server, implemented using <a href="https://sinatrarb.com" target="_blank">Sinatra</a>. The local
server then responds to the CLI agent by sending the recorded responses in
the cassette back to it, via the proxy. When the CLI sends an evidence query
to the server, the framework tests that the query matches the recorded,
previously-sent query during the capturing process.</p></li></ol>
<p>An important thing to remember here is that the agent does not test for the
consistency of the responses from the SCA server and the library repository with
previously-recorded responses. That is, the previously-recorded responses are
only used for replaying the responses of the SCA server and the library
repository to the CLI agent. This is because <strong>the test subject is the CLI
agent</strong>, and therefore we focus our effort in matching the requests with the
recorded requests, since the requests are the outputs of the agent.</p><p>The CLI agent supports scanning projects implemented using a variety of
languages and build systems from Java Maven projects to Objective-C with
Cocoapods and even C/C++ with <code>make</code>. Due to a large number and variety of
tests, the scanned projects are divided into test <em>suites</em> for which currently
there are 17. The suites and the functional testing are executed in parallel
(whenever CPU resources are available) in the Gitlab CI. The name of the CI test
job indicates the kind of repositories that are scanned by the CLI agent for
testing. The following shows all the suites as shown by the Gitlab CI web
interface, but also including the integration testing job, whose name is
<code>functional</code>.</p><p><img alt="CLI Agent Test Jobs" src="../images/test-jobs.png"></p><h2 id="afterthoughts">Afterthoughts</h2><p>System testing for a client/server system has many facets. Here we have
discussed several of them, including matching network interactions. At the
moment we cannot guarantee that our design has been optimal. Our framework has
weaknesses, the most important one is that changes in the environments may cause
test failures. For some of the example repositories that we scan, the specified
dependency version constraints in the build file can be too weak such that the
the replay fails not because of regression, but because dependency version
numbers that are detected in new scans do not match the recorded version
dependencies. For issues such as these, future improvements can be made, such as
having a mock library repository that does not (frequently) update the versions
of the libraries it host.</p>
